Notably, chaplocal is a cool and easy way to create "development containers" instantly
based upon chaperone-baseimage or chaperone-lamp.

For example, if you say:
    ./chaplocal garywiz/chaperone-lamp devtest

... you will automatically have a new directory devtest which contains a complete running
application "world" which is owned by you.  Both Apache and MySQL will be running under your
user account, and all development and log files can be inspected and managed easily.

When you've got your apps directory set up, all you need to do is copy it to '/' and create
a container image with your own /apps hierarchy.  Running it normally without the chaperone
--create option should then run a production instance of your application or service.
